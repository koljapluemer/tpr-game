- see that layout behaves on LTR
- get credits for all icons I may use from https://game-icons.net
- hook up custom cursor again
	- logic is somewhere but got disconnected by refactor

- *left as a warning:*
  - handle tutor being already on target
	- ...and more importantly, same with the player
  - guard against export variables in the various script being simply not set
