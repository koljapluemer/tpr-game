### Next big steps

- start tracking quest performance

### Todo if game not fundamentally changed

- take care of proper logging-to-file
- scene (as in `level_template`) follow no clear inheritance
- document how to name keys
- make sure that scenes don't crash when loaded on their own (getting good @ godot)
