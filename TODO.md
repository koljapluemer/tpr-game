- guard against export variables in the various script being simply not set
- make a condition type resource that can do stuff like "end event once player moved in both direction"
- Sequence class is probably superflous, can just expect an Events:Node2D holder and execute in "order", with Conditionals?

- prompt user to walk to the trigger areas in tutorial level
- some way of auto-setting the children of an event as condition export vars?
